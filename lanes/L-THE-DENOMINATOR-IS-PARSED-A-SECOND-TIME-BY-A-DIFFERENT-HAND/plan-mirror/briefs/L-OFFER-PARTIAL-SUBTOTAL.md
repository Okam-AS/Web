# Brief — L-OFFER-PARTIAL-SUBTOTAL

export PLAN_ACTOR=agent:L-OFFER-PARTIAL-SUBTOTAL

## Objective
a subtotal stops presenting a partial sum as a whole one

**Found by `L-PRICE-CLEANUP-TWO` outside its own scope, measured on a real mount rather than reasoned
about, and deliberately not improvised into that diff.**

`components/shared/OfferDocument.vue` totals its lines with `(item.monthlyFee * item.quantity || 0)`, so
**an unstated fee is summed as nothing.** The measured render: the lines read
`["kr 499,00", "—"]` while the subtotal beneath prints **`kr 499,00`**.

**That combination is the defect, and it is worse than either half alone.** The line is honest — it says it
does not know the fee. The total then quietly treats *unknown* as *zero* and presents a partial sum as a
whole one. A reader who trusts the line has every reason to trust the total, and the document gives them
no way to tell the two apart.

**It is user-visible**, unlike the two traps that lane was sent to remove: the offer document is reachable
at `/offer/:code` and `/admin/offers`, and an offer is a document somebody quotes a price from.

The right home is `statedSum` and `test/price-bypass-legacy.test.js`, which already own this family.

**Three worlds, not two** — a stated fee, a genuine zero, and an absent one. The middle case is the one a
truthiness guard eats, and `!0` is `true`, so `|| 0` cannot be replaced by another falsiness test.
**Decide deliberately what a partial subtotal should say** and record the reasoning: refusing to total at
all, totalling what is stated and marking it partial, and printing the absence mark are all defensible, and
they are not the same promise to a reader.

**Check the other totals in the same document before closing.** One line of this shape usually has
siblings, and a fix to the one that was found leaves a document that is right in the place somebody looked.

## Exit criteria
an offer whose line has no stated fee renders a subtotal that says so rather than a smaller number, pinned over a stated fee, a genuine zero and an absent one, recorded in lanes/L-OFFER-PARTIAL-SUBTOTAL/mutation-log.md

## Constraints in force
- C1: Append-only tables are never backfilled, repaired in place, or purged.
  holds_because: The journal projections, deposit receipts, statement lines, consent receipts and personnel records are the evidence a bokføring, Skatteetaten or Datatilsynet inspector reads. A row that changed after the fact is worth nothing to them, and the deny-triggers already on those tables are the only thing that makes the claim checkable instead of a promise. Written now because the estate has already shipped one defect of exactly this shape — an RF-1313 systembeskrivelse asserting database triggers that no migration in the chain creates.
  violated_when: a diff contains an UPDATE or DELETE statement — in a migration, a script, or raw SQL — against a table carrying an append-only deny-trigger or the GuardAppendOnly guard; or an EF entity mapped to one of those tables is mutated and saved outside its documented append path.
- C2: One migration author at a time, and the chain is the truth, not the model.
  holds_because: Two lanes generating EF migrations against one DbContext produce two snapshots that each claim to be the model, and the chain then replays in an order neither author tested — the failure surfaces on a fresh database and never on the author's. The estate has been bitten twice already: a chain that cannot replay from empty because two migrations both add Orders.TableId, and AccountingSummaries, whose unique index exists in the model and in every model-built test database but in no migration.
  violated_when: a diff adds a migration whose Designer snapshot's parent id is not the current chain tip, or two migration files on one branch share a parent; or a diff adds an index, unique constraint or check constraint in OnModelCreating without a migration in the same diff creating it.
- C3: A capability exists only when it is reachable; service, DI registration, route and navigation entry land in the same change.
  holds_because: On 2026-07-29 four of five module journeys stopped at a missing wire while the suite was green — a service with no controller, a feature flag with no lever and no bound Configure<>, a seed with no production caller, a page nothing linked to. A green suite cannot see code that no caller can reach, so reachability has to be a property the diff carries rather than a property the tests are asked for afterwards.
  violated_when: a diff adds a service or handler that no controller action and no DI registration references; or adds a page under pages/ that no navigation surface links to; or adds a feature flag with no operator lever; and the same diff does not close the gap.
- C4: Every money-path write names the actor that caused it.
  holds_because: A deposit, a capture, a refund, a settlement line, a funded order and a payroll-bearing hour are all rows somebody will later have to explain. If a webhook, a background job and an operator can each write the same row under different — or absent — actor identity, the audit trail names nobody and the kroner cannot be traced back to a decision. Events has already had to re-prove its attribution twice against a world a prior lane had changed underneath it.
  violated_when: a money-path write (deposit, capture, refund, settlement or statement line, funded order, timesheet cost) is reachable from a code path that carries no resolved actor, or a test constructs one with a null, ambient or hard-coded system actor.
- C5: Acceptance is a person completing the journey, never a suite reporting green.
  holds_because: Standing law (Sven, 2026-07-28) — drive each feature to the end, then open the UI so he walks it himself; his acceptance is the gate. The estate has repeatedly shipped green suites over unreachable features, so a suite result is evidence that code behaves, never evidence that a capability exists. This branch has no browser-level test framework at all, which makes the rule load-bearing rather than decorative.
  violated_when: an item is moved to verified or accepted whose only named evidence is a .trx, a junit file, a suite-kind fact, or a test name; or a status message offers a suite count as the reason a capability is finished.
- C6: A statutory claim is printed only where the document it claims can be produced.
  holds_because: The product names Norwegian law on screen — personalliste under bokføringsforskriften § 8-5-6, kassasystemforskrifta, internkontroll. Each of those names promises an artifact an inspector may demand on the day, and an unbacked claim is worse than a missing feature because it invites the inspection it cannot survive. On 2026-07-30 the internkontroll claim was taken back off the UI for exactly this reason; the personalliste's identity-code substitution is the same shape and is still open.
  violated_when: a UI string, export or generated document names a Norwegian statute, forskrift or § reference while no code path in the same change produces the artifact that provision requires, and no Flag in this plan records the gap.
- C7: Secrets and credentials never reach a log sink.
  holds_because: Application Insights retains what is written to it, so a credential logged at any level is a credential published to everyone with portal access and to history nobody can edit afterwards. The estate has paid this twice — the Wolt callback signing secret and a live refresh token, both at Information level — and both times the rotation, not the code fix, was the expensive part.
  violated_when: a diff adds a log or telemetry call whose message template or argument list carries a token, secret, key, signature or password-bearing property, at any level including Error.
