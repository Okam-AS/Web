# Brief — L-GUARD-REPAIR-LANDS

export PLAN_ACTOR=agent:L-GUARD-REPAIR-LANDS

## Objective
the repair exists on no ref and breaks the other prover

**The fix for the dead journey guard is uncommitted working-tree state in another lane's worktree, on 0 of 115
refs.** Everything the estate now believes about journey evidence rests on a change that a single
`git checkout --` would erase, in a directory nobody owns.

**And landing it as-is breaks the other prover.** `build-provenance-proof.js` carries **its own hand-written
list of four**, omitting `fixture-provenance.js` — which the repaired `journey.js:150` requires. Measured both
ways: **5 of 5 pass with the committed `journey.js`, 5 of 5 fail under the repair.** It fails loudly rather
than spuriously, which is the good news; it is still a landing blocker, and it blocks re-establishing ten
`arm-N` receipts.

**The remedy is one line and the discipline is the point.** Both provers copy a hand-written file list, and
**both lists have now gone stale by something unrelated being fixed** — that is the mechanism, not the
individual omission. Adopt the shared `harness-copy.js` in both, so the next `require` added anywhere does not
silently kill a prover.

**Prove the repair the way the census did.** Re-measure `guard-proof.js` yourself at 10 of 10 rather than
taking it on report, and then show `build-provenance-proof.js` at 5 of 5 **at the same ref** — the two have
never yet been green together.

**And keep the falsification.** A prover that passes because it copied fewer files is the failure being fixed.
**Break one arm on purpose and show the run reds**, or the green means only that nothing loaded.

**Commit by pathspec into your own worktree.** Do not touch `web-whoanswered` — that is where the uncommitted
repair lives, and it is another lane's tree.

## Exit criteria
guard-proof.js and build-provenance-proof.js both pass from a committed ref that carries the shared harness copier, shown by both provers run at that ref and recorded in lanes/L-GUARD-REPAIR-LANDS/run.md

## Constraints in force
- C1: Append-only tables are never backfilled, repaired in place, or purged.
  holds_because: The journal projections, deposit receipts, statement lines, consent receipts and personnel records are the evidence a bokføring, Skatteetaten or Datatilsynet inspector reads. A row that changed after the fact is worth nothing to them, and the deny-triggers already on those tables are the only thing that makes the claim checkable instead of a promise. Written now because the estate has already shipped one defect of exactly this shape — an RF-1313 systembeskrivelse asserting database triggers that no migration in the chain creates.
  violated_when: a diff contains an UPDATE or DELETE statement — in a migration, a script, or raw SQL — against a table carrying an append-only deny-trigger or the GuardAppendOnly guard; or an EF entity mapped to one of those tables is mutated and saved outside its documented append path.
- C2: One migration author at a time, and the chain is the truth, not the model.
  holds_because: Two lanes generating EF migrations against one DbContext produce two snapshots that each claim to be the model, and the chain then replays in an order neither author tested — the failure surfaces on a fresh database and never on the author's. The estate has been bitten twice already: a chain that cannot replay from empty because two migrations both add Orders.TableId, and AccountingSummaries, whose unique index exists in the model and in every model-built test database but in no migration.
  violated_when: a diff adds a migration whose Designer snapshot's parent id is not the current chain tip, or two migration files on one branch share a parent; or a diff adds an index, unique constraint or check constraint in OnModelCreating without a migration in the same diff creating it.
- C3: A capability exists only when it is reachable; service, DI registration, route and navigation entry land in the same change.
  holds_because: On 2026-07-29 four of five module journeys stopped at a missing wire while the suite was green — a service with no controller, a feature flag with no lever and no bound Configure<>, a seed with no production caller, a page nothing linked to. A green suite cannot see code that no caller can reach, so reachability has to be a property the diff carries rather than a property the tests are asked for afterwards.
  violated_when: a diff adds a service or handler that no controller action and no DI registration references; or adds a page under pages/ that no navigation surface links to; or adds a feature flag with no operator lever; and the same diff does not close the gap.
- C4: Every money-path write names the actor that caused it.
  holds_because: A deposit, a capture, a refund, a settlement line, a funded order and a payroll-bearing hour are all rows somebody will later have to explain. If a webhook, a background job and an operator can each write the same row under different — or absent — actor identity, the audit trail names nobody and the kroner cannot be traced back to a decision. Events has already had to re-prove its attribution twice against a world a prior lane had changed underneath it.
  violated_when: a money-path write (deposit, capture, refund, settlement or statement line, funded order, timesheet cost) is reachable from a code path that carries no resolved actor, or a test constructs one with a null, ambient or hard-coded system actor.
- C5: Acceptance is a person completing the journey, never a suite reporting green.
  holds_because: Standing law (Sven, 2026-07-28) — drive each feature to the end, then open the UI so he walks it himself; his acceptance is the gate. The estate has repeatedly shipped green suites over unreachable features, so a suite result is evidence that code behaves, never evidence that a capability exists. This branch has no browser-level test framework at all, which makes the rule load-bearing rather than decorative.
  violated_when: an item is moved to verified or accepted whose only named evidence is a .trx, a junit file, a suite-kind fact, or a test name; or a status message offers a suite count as the reason a capability is finished.
- C6: A statutory claim is printed only where the document it claims can be produced.
  holds_because: The product names Norwegian law on screen — personalliste under bokføringsforskriften § 8-5-6, kassasystemforskrifta, internkontroll. Each of those names promises an artifact an inspector may demand on the day, and an unbacked claim is worse than a missing feature because it invites the inspection it cannot survive. On 2026-07-30 the internkontroll claim was taken back off the UI for exactly this reason; the personalliste's identity-code substitution is the same shape and is still open.
  violated_when: a UI string, export or generated document names a Norwegian statute, forskrift or § reference while no code path in the same change produces the artifact that provision requires, and no Flag in this plan records the gap.
- C7: Secrets and credentials never reach a log sink.
  holds_because: Application Insights retains what is written to it, so a credential logged at any level is a credential published to everyone with portal access and to history nobody can edit afterwards. The estate has paid this twice — the Wolt callback signing secret and a live refresh token, both at Information level — and both times the rotation, not the code fix, was the expensive part.
  violated_when: a diff adds a log or telemetry call whose message template or argument list carries a token, secret, key, signature or password-bearing property, at any level including Error.

## Boundaries
You may not run `plan accept` or `plan decide`.
You may not edit docs/plan/** except your RETURN.
If the brief contradicts reality, stop and return verdict fail-spec — do not improvise.

## Return protocol
Write this block to docs/plan/returns/L-GUARD-REPAIR-LANDS-<n>.md and hand it back:
